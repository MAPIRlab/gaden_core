- Building and environment (Q1): Not that related, but they publish a lot of GSL stuff
- SoftwareX (Q2): A pretty good match.
- International Journal of Simulation Modelling (Q2): Does publish articles about simulation software.
- International Journal of Modeling Simulation and Scientific Computing (Q3): Maybe, but they don't seem to publish about software tools very much.
