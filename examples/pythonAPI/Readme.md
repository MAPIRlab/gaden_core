# Python bindings usage
**After** building into `(repo root)/build` with the `GENERATE_PYTHON_BINDINGS` option, run the [CreateLink](CreateLink.sh) script to make the bindings module accessible here. If you built the binaries into a different path, you will have to modify the script.

Then, you can access the library as seen in the [RunSimulation](RunSimulation.py) example.
